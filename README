Issues directory with GitHub API
================================

This app follows the standard Play package structure. The main controller is OAuth2.scala, and here is where the data given by GitHub after a succeed login is processed.

Under Models.scala you can find all the necessary case classes for parsing between the JSON given by GitHub and our models.

The view where all the information is displayed is contained inside repository.scala.html

The app was built using SBT, and can be run by using the standard 'sbt run' command.

The first page displayed after accessing the URL redirects to GitHub, where the user will be asked to input his login information, and then it will be redirected back again to our app, where all the information about repositories and issues will be displayed.
